## Modernize to cloud, and on cloud 

Cloud migration has been a major trend in the past years. "Lift & Shift" migrations allowed organizations to rapidly benefit from cloud infrastructure capabilities with minimal disruption and effective costs.

However, Rehosted applications may not leverage all the powerful capabilities of cloud-native services including high performance, automated scalability, security, resiliency or more advanced services such as modern databases, analytics and AI.

In fact, only a fraction of applications have been migrated to the cloud. Applications still on premises are typically the most complex or monolithic stacks, developed over the years by changing development teams, with limited documentation, where Rearchitecting or heavy Refactoring is necessary before considering a cloud migration. Before engaging in such an endeavour, organizations need to make sure that the technical knowledge base of those applications is available.

### How CAST can help

In a week, organizations can the scan source code of hundreds of custom applications on CAST Highlight to automatically categorize them using a model such as the Gartner 5Rs (Rehost, Refactor, Rearchitect, Rebuild and Retire), get a list of cloud Blockers and remediation effort estimates, recommended AWS services, open source risks (CVEs, obsolescence and copyleft license risks), as well as a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to best mitigate these risks.

CAST Highlight is non-intrusive as the source code doesn't leave the organization premises and it doesn't touch applications in production. It cover 50+ programming languages, 12+ database types and hundreds of frameworks: mainframe, Java, .NET, C# and many more. See *[here](https://doc.casthighlight.com/#technologycoverage)* for a full list.

CAST Imaging is a complementary solution (covered in another Workshop) to automatically reverse-engineer the architecture of complex applications to Rearchitect or Refactor through interactive maps.

Beyond the initial analysis, CAST Highlight is used for continuous progress monitoring of the journey-to-cloud program, providing trending views and to serve as an application knowledge base throughout the lifecycle of the applications.
